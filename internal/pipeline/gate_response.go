// splitFixResponse validates a fix response against the gate that is parked

//
// Declines are explicit: every finding the gate shows must appear in
// findingIDs or ignoreFindingIDs unless an earlier round of this step already
// decided it, and an ID in both lists or an ID the gate does not show is
// refused. The validation exists because a partial selection used to record
// its complement as declined, so an omitted finding - including one an earlier
// round had already fixed, which the round-history carry re-shows at a later
// gate - silently became a human decline and the next reviewer was told to
// undo work the same human had asked for: in a real run, round 2 recorded
// five findings a human had twice chosen to fix as declined, because the
// driving agent's response listed only the eight it meant to fix.
//
// A finding an earlier user round already decided keeps that decision when it
// is omitted (Kept), which is what makes an earlier fix sticky. Naming one of
// those findings in ignoreFindingIDs is refused when the earlier decision was
// to FIX it: a gate response cannot reverse an applied fix, so that reversal is
// out of scope here. A finding an earlier round declined may be restated as
// declined. "Earlier user round" means a round of the same step result whose
// selection came from a human - an auto-fix selection is the pipeline's own
// choice and decides nothing.
//
// The decline set itself is not stored: it is the complement of the selection
// (issue #790 decision B) minus the findings an earlier round chose to fix,
// derived on read by declinedFindingLines.
//
// The validation fails closed on unreadable state: the contract a response is
// checked against is the gate's own findings, so a payload that cannot be read
// refuses the response rather than passing as a gate that showed nothing (the
// same rule the executor applies to an unreadable round history). The gate
// stays parked, and the refusal names the problem and points at the state to
